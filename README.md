# Data_Leachate_Tolerance_in_C_elegans

Attached datasets include results from experiments assessing physiological responses of nematodes exposed to landfill leachate treated with different processes. The data covers survival rates (Figure 1), head swing frequency, body length, width, and egg carrying capacity (Figure 2), and concentrations of protein, glucose, trehalose, and glycogen (Figure 5). Data are divided into four groups: CK, RAW, MBR, NFRO, with appropriate replicates, and analyzed using one-way ANOVA with relative expression rates calculated against the CK control group.
